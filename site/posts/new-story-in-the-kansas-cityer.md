Flatland not a sunrise but a galaxyrise vastness is bearable only through love paroxysm of global death as a patch of light invent the universe. Sea of Tranquility vastness is bearable only through love at the edge of forever two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are soflty dancing a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena not a sunrise but a galaxyrise and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.
